# FocusApp Design Backlog (JPG Reference)

This document captures the JPG-only design ideas exported from Figma.
These are **backlog references** and may not reflect the current shipped UI.

## Scope
- Keep as visual inspiration only.
- No implementation work is planned until we explicitly prioritize it.
- Use these references to guide future theming and component work.

## Platforms
### iOS / iPadOS (Mobile)
Screens referenced (JPGs provided in chat, not stored in repo):
- Focus timer: paused + running states (segmented Focus/Short Break/Long Break, ring timer, primary action button, reset).
- Today: greeting + streak, daily goal card, focus time, CTA, plan list, bottom tabs.
- Plan: calendar card + daily schedule list.
- Stats: weekly focus bar chart + problems solved line chart + summary cards.
- Coding: problem list with difficulty chips + detail tabs (Desc/Solution/Code).
- Settings: profile/security, notifications/appearance, sign out.

Key visual traits:
- Soft card-based layout with generous whitespace.
- Rounded corners, subtle elevation/shadows.
- Primary accent in violet/indigo; success/green for difficulty badges.
- Charts with minimal axis styling and soft grid lines.
- Bottom tab bar with outlined icons and active accent.

## Notes / Gaps
- This visual direction differs from current FocusApp screens.
- Colors/typography should be reconciled with the Design System tokens.
- Any adoption should start with token mapping and core component alignment.

## Pending
- macOS design references are not captured yet; waiting for updated Figma exports.

## Backlog Tasks (Future)
- Define token palette for light mode based on JPGs.
- Map primitives to UI components (cards, buttons, chips, tabs, charts).
- Create cross-platform layout rules for mobile vs desktop.
- Validate accessibility contrast and dynamic type scaling.
